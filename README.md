Handbook for interacting with the DANDI archive.

## DANDI Style Sheet

Follow the guidelines below when creating and revising text in the DANDI Handbook:

*	**dandi-** repositories (hyphenate, dandi-archive, dandi-cli, *not* dandischema; dandisets is an exception because that is a
complete word, i.e. it is not using dandi as a prefix to a noun)
*	**dandiset** (**not** Dandiset)
*	file names - use lower case (e.g. **development.md**)
*	headings - use Title Capitalization (for 1st and 2nd levels) and follow with an intro sentence
*	**GitHub** camel case (**not** github or Github)
*	instructional language should be direct, imperative, active, straightforward (e.g. "Install the files in your Python environment" *not* "Files could be installed in your Python environment")
*	**JupyterHub** camel case (**not** Jupyterhub)
*	**license** (**not** licence); in general, prefer American spelling
*	limited use of "please"
*	steps should start with 1, not 0
