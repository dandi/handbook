The DANDI ecosystem includes a self-hosted Jupyter notebook service. This service is orchestrated on a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster
that provides different instance types of users to efficiently interact with data in the DANDI Archive.

[Proceed to the following README](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-hub/blob/main/README.md#dandihub) to see how you can
set up your own DANDI Hub -- **Note: it is important that your k8s cluster is in the same region
as your data**
