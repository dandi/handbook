# Work In Progress

## Setting up your GitHub OAuth Account

Please follow the steps in [Initialize Vendors - GitHub](../60_initialize_vendors/#github) to get started.

For the next steps in setting up authentication, you'll want to record the values
created during [Obtaining your Oauth App creds](..60_initialize_vendors/#obtaining-your-oauth-app-credentials).

## Creating and Updating Objects in the DANDI Archive Admin Panel

### Creating "Sites" and "Social App" Objects

*In order to complete this step, you will need to have deployed an initial DANDI Archive API -- see here for more details [Creating the DANDI Archive API](../64_dandi_archive)

First, sign in via the Django admin panel with your credentials created via the [Creating an admin user account for the DANDI Archive API step](../64_dandi_archive/#creating-a-django-superuser-admin-account)

The Django Admin panel should be located at: `<your_full_api_url/admin`

<br/><br/>

alt="admin_panel"
style="width: 60%; height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;"/>
<br/><br/>

Proceed to the `Sites` tab. Create 2 sites: one for your UI, and another for your API domain.

<br/><br/>
<img
src="../img/site_admin.png"
alt="site_admin"
style="width: 60%; height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;"/>
<br/><br/>

Proceed to the `Social applications` tab, located on the left side panel. 
Click `Add Social Application` in the top right corner.

<br/><br/>
<img
src="../img/social_app_panel.png"
alt="social_app_panel"
style="width: 60%; height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;"/>
<br/><br/>

Create a `Social Application` object with:

• The Provider as `GitHub`
• The client ID as your GitHub OAuth client ID
• The client secret as your GitHub OAuth client secret
• Two `Sites` objects -- these objects you should have created a few steps prior

### Updating (or creating) the "Application" Object

Stay signed in the Django Admin panel. Update (or create, if not present) an `Application` object. Similar to the steps above,
populate the client ID with your Github OAuth client ID. See the screenshot below for the configuration that would be appropriate.

If this object exists (it can if you ran migrations first or deployed to Heroku), update the values to your appropriate redirect URLs and client ID.

<img

alt="django_app"
style="width: 60%; height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;"/>
<br/><br/>

After creating this object, you are all set in the Django Admin panel for now.

## Populating appropriate values for the frontend to handle authentication

This step assumes that you have [successfully set up your Netlify account](../60_initialize_vendors/#netlify).

There are two places that you'll want to update values relevant to your frontend.

- `netlify.toml`
- `.env.production`

For `netlify.toml`: This should be located in the `web/` sub-directory -- [see DANDI Archive web/netlify.toml](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-archive/blob/master/web/netlify.toml). This is a file in which you can configure different settings for different environments in Netlify

For `.env.production`: This should also be located in the `web/` sub-directory --  [see DANDI Archive web/.env.production](https://github.com/dandi/dandi-archive/blob/master/web/.env.production). This is a file that will inject environment variables into the frontend upon build (e.g. `vite build`)

Update the relevant values that reflect what was in your `Social Application` object for both files. You will also notice an environment variable related to `Sentry` -- this value can be obtained from your Sentry account.
